[["index.html", "A Guide To Surviving Big Data and Psychological Science Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 How to use this guide 1.2 General strategies for the course 1.3 How to search for stuff you don’t understand 1.4 About us", " A Guide To Surviving Big Data and Psychological Science Joshua Hew and Jana Tomastikova 2024-11-08 Chapter 1 Introduction There’s courses you don’t have to worry about too much and then there is Big Data. This (unofficial) guide offers some basic tools and strategies that we think you might find useful, so that you put your amazing research ideas into work without getting stuck on the practical bits (although you will most likely get stuck anyways). This is by no means all you should know or all you should expect you should know (and not officially a part of the course content). These are just some things that previous students on the course found important to know. We hope it helps. 1.1 How to use this guide Just flick through the pages and find whatever is useful to you. 1.2 General strategies for the course This course is hard. But if you put the effort in, it’s highly rewarding, no matter what mark you get. The main part of the course is your research project, which is grounded in what you learn in the lectures and tutorials (so you better show up to them). Participate, ask questions, talk to Zach, he’s there to help (and we are here too). You will learn by doing (and googling when things don’t work - follow on to the next section). 1.3 How to search for stuff you don’t understand Learn how to read documentation for libraries/functions, most can be found on CRAN. you can search a function in the documentation by typing this into the console: ?cor.test you can also use two question marks to search the documentation for a word or a phrase: ??tokenize Most packages have a tutorial or readme document that explains how and when to use them. (search for them!) ChatGPT can help with code but using it means you won’t actually understand the code. Better to just follow a tutorial and implement it yourself. 1.4 About us Joshua (s2144522@ed.ac.uk) Jana (s2158655@ed.ac.uk) Do let us know if there are errors on this guidebook. We basically live in 7GS so feel free to approach whenever. Also, we survived the course.

After graduating I honestly had no idea what career path I was interested in pursuing other than becoming a psychiatrist or pursuing nursing. \\n\\nMy main goal has been trying to gain experience working in the psych field. \\nI’ve worked as a behavior technician in the ABA field and really enjoyed the type of work I get to do with children with autism. I’ve done this job for a little over a year but the pay is very low and not something I want to keep pursuing long term. I really want to pursue a career that allows me to help others in crisis and implement a plan of action for them. I kinda feel lost and not entirely sure what next steps I want to take. \\n\\nI’m 26 and I’m due with my first child in a couple months. I really want to focus on a career that allows me to help others while also making a livable wage. I knew going into psychology I wouldn’t make a lot with a bachelor degree but feel really pathetic barely making $35,000 per year at my job. Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. \\n\\nI honestly really want to pursue psychiatric nursing but not sure what the right direction to accomplish this would be. ## 4 I am from Pakistan and I recently graduated BS Psychology and now I&#39;m looking to apply in mphil programs. I am confused about which field to specialise in. I know what happens in clinical settings, if I choose clinical psychology. Which is the safer option. But I&#39;m also interested in organisational setup and managing and understanding the system there. But I have yet to meet someone who does this in Pakistan and I really want to know their experience and their responsibilities before I make any decisions. Even if you&#39;re not from Pakistan, I&#39;d still like your opinion on it. What scope does it have and what are the growth and development chances for me if I choose this field? How can i make my career grow and what are the options ahead. I just dont want to be stuck at one place. ## 5 i so i like nursing and psychology so i kinda condescend what i like to do after undergrad into two options atm. one of them is a psychiatric nurse practitioner. i also still want to be a psychologist as the end goal. is there a way i can still get my PhD in psychology? ## 6 I learned all the regions of the brain in intro classes but most of that specific info didn&#39;t stick with me. Now that I&#39;m in higher level courses it feels like I&#39;m expected to know that stuff off the top of my head. What&#39;s a good way to memorize it in a way that&#39;ll stick? Or any specific resources that I can use? ## created upvotes downvotes flair ## 1 1665796824 384 0 Resource/Study ## 2 1714615614 10 0 Study Megathread ## 3 1724121109 11 0 Advice/Career ## 4 1724144861 3 0 Advice/Career ## 5 1724133359 3 0 Advice/Career ## 6 1724113959 6 0 Search ## comments ## 1 [&#39;There’s lots of research suggesting that evidence-based art therapy can be impactful in a variety of settings and psychological conditions. I’d be interested to see the source on that particular paragraph, which is essentially discrediting an entire field encompassing art therapy, music therapy, and other expressive art therapy modalities.&#39;, &#39;Thank you, it will definitely be helpful.&#39;, &quot;I have slightly modified the language of that paragraph to better communicate the message I initially intended. What it was meant to communicate is that expressive arts therapy careers outside the context of otherwise being licensed to practice psychotherapy are limited, since the person would not be allowed to practice outside of this very narrow scope. There are some locales in the US where one can practice creative arts therapy without being licensed to practice other forms of psychotherapy. Also, yes, there is evidence in favor of creative arts therapy, but, again, this evidence suggests the benefits largely exist for mood disturbances and anxiety and that they are transient (in other words, the benefits last during and for shortly after the activity, but do not necessarily last for long periods after the activity has been completed--much like any recreational activity). Therefore, these therapies are best practiced (and most efficacious when practiced) within the context of other EBTs, such as CBT, rather than as a stand-alone treatment, since the goal of CBT or another EBT would be to teach a *lasting* skill which would provide long-term symptom mitigation. People who can practice expressive arts therapy but not other forms of psychotherapy (in places where that is allowed) are therefore going to find their employment opportunities limited. Licensed psychotherapists who have the fuller scope of practice and are *also* competent in expressive arts therapy will not experience this limitation. That&#39;s the original intent of the paragraph--thanks for pointing out that the language was confusing!&quot;] ## 2 [&quot;**Do you believe in true love?

We are interested in the ways students can address or counteract feelings of distress emerging from these academic stress sources. We are specifically curious about how feelings of overall satisfaction in life can be maximised for students currently engaging in stress-inducing academic activities. \\\\n\\\\nOur area of research is concerned with how taking an approach to life focussing on excellence rather than perfection (that is, creating high yet achievable standards, having flexible goals and finding satisfaction in accomplishments) and realistic goal-setting can reduce distress, and if participating in non-academic leisure or hobby activities can help students cope with experienced distress. \\\\n\\\\nIf you decide that you’d like to take part in this research, you’ll complete an online survey comprising 58 questions, including questions about your experiences with academic stressors, feelings of distress, overall life satisfaction, excellencism, and extracurricular activity engagement, as well as questions regarding your assigned sex at birth, gender, sexual orientation, age, undergraduate degree enrolled in, and year of study.

In the US, either an associates or a Bachelors of Science in Nursing. A bachelors is going to make you more competitive. There’s a psych nurse subreddit you can look at.\\\\n\\\\nAs far as a decent paying job with a bachelors in psychology, there are only a few jobs that you can get that require that specific degree. Case management, research assistant, hospital liaison connecting people leaving inpatient to outpatient services. But honestly those jobs aren’t going to pay super well. Maybe a little more than you’re making now. You really do need at least a masters in order to make a well paying career for yourself in psychology.&#39;, &#39;County jobs like CPS, Probation, mental health case manager. State jobs like parole, forensics, prisons, state hospitals and regional centers. Social work jobs.&#39;, &#39;Yeah that’s what I figured, fortunately the local state university where I live would be willing to apply my already existing bachelor degree with their bachelor’s in nursing, I would need to take a couple of more courses but in theory I could get a second bachelor’s degree. What makes me nervous about graduate school is the amount of debt I would need to take on vs going to nursing school would be a cheaper option.&#39;, &#39;Nursing is a very flexible career and you’re guaranteed a job anywhere. Also working three 12 hour shifts is pretty nice if you’re working on an inpatient unit.&#39;, &#39;Or you could do a direct entry MSN and eventually become a NP&#39;] ## 4 [] ## 5 [&#39;Following&#39;, &#39;two totally different professions. you can be a prescribing psychologists in some states in the US if prescribing is what youre interested in. for now youll have to choose to begin pursuing one or the other, but life is long? maybe youll have time for two careers lol&#39;, &#39;Yes, you can do both. But you can also do therapy with just the psych NP (though you’ll probably want extra training) and you’ll be reimbursed more per hour if that than if you were a psychologist, at least in the US.&#39;, &#39;omgg waitt what is that? i’m very curious now, bc i want to be a neuropsychologist or clinical psychologist. either way i find those two paths furfilling depending upon what imma decide in what i’m going to do for my doctorate.&#39;] ## 6 [&#39;Get a white board and hang it in a central location, somewhere that you will see it multiple times a day. Draw a picture and label all the parts, and just get into the habit of looking at it every time you walk by. Seeing it with repetition and really analyzing it, eventually you will just start remembering. Thats what I did.&#39;] That’s a bit chunky, why not we get rid of some variables? 2.1.1 select() The select() function allows you retain specific columns (variables) by name from a dataframe. psych_df %&gt;% select(title) %&gt;% head() ## title ## 1 [USA] Read this if you are interested in a career in mental healthcare ## 2 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## 3 What are some decent paying jobs you can do with a bachelors in psychology? ## 4 Any Organisational Psychlogist here? ## 5 can i be a psychiatric nurse practitioner and get a PhD? ## 6 How to memorize regions of the brain?

Here, the score, id, and subreddit are columns 3, 4, and 5 respectively. psych_df %&gt;% select(c(3:5)) %&gt;% head() 2.1.2 filter() Recall that to call upon specific rows we can do this: psych_df[4:7,] %&gt;% select(title) ## title ## 4 Any Organisational Psychlogist here? ## 5 can i be a psychiatric nurse practitioner and get a PhD? ## 6 How to memorize regions of the brain? ## 7 Bsc Psychology Student at 26, transitioning from RPN Which outputs rows 4 to 7. The filter function allows you to select specific rows that fit one or multiple criterion in your dataframe. To get titles that have a Reddit score of 25 or more: psych_df %&gt;% filter(score &gt; 25) %&gt;% select(title, score) ## title score ## 1 [USA] Read this if you are interested in a career in mental healthcare 384 ## 2 Why do clinical psychologists get paid so little compared to other professions? 44 ## 3 I regret not choosing Psychology 96 ## 4 people say a bachelor’s in psych is useless: true or false? 115 You can also input multiple logical conditions by adding more operators such as &amp; or |. For a score of more than 25 and a “Discussion” flair. psych_df %&gt;% filter(score &gt; 25 &amp; flair == &quot;Discussion&quot;) %&gt;% select(title, score, flair) ## title score flair ## 1 I regret not choosing Psychology 96 Discussion For a score of 100 or more OR a “Study Megathread” flair. psych_df %&gt;% filter(score &gt;= 100 | flair == &quot;Study Megathread&quot;) %&gt;% select(title, score, flair) ## title score ## 1 [USA] Read this if you are interested in a career in mental healthcare 384 ## 2 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread 10 ## 3 people say a bachelor’s in psych is useless: true or false? 115 ## flair ## 1 Resource/Study ## 2 Study Megathread ## 3 Question 2.1.3 arrange() Say I would like to look at 5 entries with the highest score.

Arrange() sorts the dataframe in ascending order by default: psych_df %&gt;% select(title, score) %&gt;% arrange((score))%&gt;% head(5) ## title score ## 1 Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) after finishing doctorates? 0 ## 2 I wish there was a Worldwide Accreditation - or is there? 0 ## 3 Does an accredited graduate program matter? 0 ## 4 Are tics just self-made body addictions? 0 ## 5 Is it possible to study in a different country? 0 Oh, seems like there might be more than 5 entries that scored a zero. Let’s count how many using count(): psych_df %&gt;% filter(score==0) %&gt;% count(score) ## score n ## 1 0 8 Seems like there are 8 entries with the score of 0. 2.1.4 rbind() This function is a super useful one. It binds rows of two or more dataframes together. Let’s say I have these two dataframes: good_people ## name died ## 1 Cedric Diggory Goblet of Fire ## 2 Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows ## 3 Alastor Moody Deathly Hallows ## 4 Albus Dumbledore Half Blood Prince ## 5 Sirius Black Order of the Phoenix bad_people ## name died ## 1 Bellatrix Lestrange Deathly Hallows ## 2 Basilisk Chamber of Secrets ## 3 Voldemort Deathly Hallows ## 4 Barty Crouch Sr. Goblet of Fire ## 5 Professor Quirrell Philosopher&#39;s Stone Now it’s time to use the rbind() function to bind the datasets together into one dataset. BUT, before we do that, it’s good practice to add hp_characters &lt;- rbind(good_people,bad_people) hp_characters ## name died ## 1 Cedric Diggory Goblet of Fire ## 2 Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows ## 3 Alastor Moody Deathly Hallows ## 4 Albus Dumbledore Half Blood Prince ## 5 Sirius Black Order of the Phoenix ## 6 Bellatrix Lestrange Deathly Hallows ## 7 Basilisk Chamber of Secrets ## 8 Voldemort Deathly Hallows ## 9 Barty Crouch Sr. Goblet of Fire ## 10 Professor Quirrell Philosopher&#39;s Stone Great, so the rows of the second dataset (bad_people) were now added underneath the rows of the first dataset (good_people). But wait, what if someone doesn’t know the characters that well so can’t distinguish which characters are good or bad? It is good practice to add an extra column to each of the datasets beforehand so that you know where this data came from. Let’s do that again: good_people &lt;- good_people%&gt;% mutate(identity=&quot;good&quot;) bad_people &lt;- bad_people%&gt;% mutate(identity=&quot;bad&quot;) hp_characters &lt;- rbind(good_people,bad_people) hp_characters ## name died identity ## 1 Cedric Diggory Goblet of Fire good ## 2 Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows good ## 3 Alastor Moody Deathly Hallows good ## 4 Albus Dumbledore Half Blood Prince good ## 5 Sirius Black Order of the Phoenix good ## 6 Bellatrix Lestrange Deathly Hallows bad ## 7 Basilisk Chamber of Secrets bad ## 8 Voldemort Deathly Hallows bad ## 9 Barty Crouch Sr. Goblet of Fire bad ## 10 Professor Quirrell Philosopher&#39;s Stone bad That’s better. 2.1.5 cbind() This function is similar to rbind(), but instead of rows, it binds the columns (the c in cbind) of the datasets together. I have another dataset (actually just a column) that contains info about the house each of these characters are in: house_info ## house ## 1 Hufflepuff ## 2 Gryffindoor ## 3 Unknown ## 4 Gryfindoor ## 5 Gryffindoor ## 6 Slytherin ## 7 NA ## 8 Slytherin ## 9 Unknown ## 10 Ravenclaw Let’s add it to the hp_characters dataset. hp_characters_info &lt;- cbind(hp_characters,house_info) hp_characters_info ## name died identity house ## 1 Cedric Diggory Goblet of Fire good Hufflepuff ## 2 Remus Lupin Deathly Hallows good Gryffindoor ## 3 Alastor Moody Deathly Hallows good Unknown ## 4 Albus Dumbledore Half Blood Prince good Gryfindoor ## 5 Sirius Black Order of the Phoenix good Gryffindoor ## 6 Bellatrix Lestrange Deathly Hallows bad Slytherin ## 7 Basilisk Chamber of Secrets bad NA ## 8 Voldemort Deathly Hallows bad Slytherin ## 9 Barty Crouch Sr. Goblet of Fire bad Unknown ## 10 Professor Quirrell Philosopher&#39;s Stone bad Ravenclaw Note: Make sure that the number of rows match, otherwise you will get an error :/. Also, both the rows and the columns just get appended in the order that they are in. So make sure you double check that the data is as you want it to be. 2.1.6 write.csv() This function is good for when you want to save a dataset that you have created/cleaned in R to your computer as a csv file (which you can then put on OSF or something). This is the syntax: write.csv(hp_characters_info,&quot;./data/filename.csv&quot;) Note: The “./data/filename.csv” part of the argument specifies the path to the directory where you want to save it, ending with your chosen file name. If you don’t specify the path, it will save it in your current directory. 2.2 For working with text Let’s go back to the r/psychologystudents dataset and see what tools for working with text we can use. 2.2.1 gsub() This function let’s you substitute a string or the characters in a vector or a dataframe with another string. It’s very useful for data cleaning. For example, many big datasets of online comments usually contain a lot of links (URLs). In most cases, we are not interested in those links, as they might interfere with our analyses (although sometimes they might also be interesting). There is a way to get rid of/replace things we are not interested in. The syntax of gsub() is the following: gsub(pattern, replacement, x) pattern: The pattern or the string that you want to replace replacement: A string you want to input instead of the pattern. x: the dataset/column you want the replacement to happen If we wanted to replace all hashtags with a blank space (basically just get rid of them) in the body column of our dataframe, we could do this: psych_df$body &lt;- gsub(&quot;#&quot;,&quot;&quot;,psych_df$body) It gets more complicated if you want to do more complex things. You can replace multiple patterns, or work with something called Regular Expressions (we have a separate tab on what regular expressions are because it sort of has its own lore). For some more advanced pattern matching with gsub(), click here or surf the internet. Here is an example for how to get rid of URLs in the psych_df dataset: psych_df$body &lt;- gsub(&quot;http\\\\S+|www\\\\S+|https\\\\S+&quot;, &quot;&quot;, psych_df$body) Breakdown of the syntax: http: This matches the literal string “http”. \\\\S+: \\\\S matches any non-whitespace character. (In R, the backslash is escaped by doubling it, so \\S becomes in regex, where S stands for non-whitespace.) The + means “one or more” of the preceding character (i.e., one or more non-whitespace characters). This matches the rest of the URL after “http” (like http://example.com). | (OR operator): This allows for multiple patterns to be matched. It means “or”, so the regex will match either the first part before |, or the part after it. www: This matches the literal string “www”. This pattern is to catch URLs that start with “www” but might not have “http” or “https” at the beginning. \\\\S+ (again): Similar to the explanation above, this matches the non-whitespace part of the URL after “www”. https: This matches the literal string “https”. \\\\S+: Again, this matches the rest of the URL after “https”. The gsub() function then removes these matches (i.e., replaces them with an empty string ““). 2.2.2 unnest_tokens() This is a very handy one and Zach for sure had already mentioned it. Unnest_tokens() splits your desired text column into “tokens”, one token per row. A token could be one word, or two words, or three, or sentences, or so on. This function is a good start for when you want to, say, count the instances of certain words, or do more interesting analyses, like find which words are unique to specific groups or datasets. The basic syntax looks like this: unnest_tokens(dataframe, output, input) output: Output column to be created as string or symbol. This is usually something like “words” or “ngram”. input: Input column that gets split as string or symbol. This is the name of your column you want split, usually “text” or “body”. Let’s try it on our psych_df data: library(tidytext) # this is where the function comes from unnested &lt;- psych_df %&gt;% unnest_tokens(word,body) Let’s have a look at the first 10 rows of our newly created words column. head(unnested,10)%&gt;% select(word) ## word ## 1 if ## 2 you ## 3 are ## 4 interested ## 5 in ## 6 pursuing ## 7 a ## 8 career ## 9 in ## 10 mental Each word has it’s own row now. Cool, let’s count the words and look at the most used ones: unnested %&gt;% count(word, sort=TRUE)%&gt;% top_n(10, n) # selects the top 10 by the count ## word n ## 1 i 489 ## 2 to 426 ## 3 a 309 ## 4 and 295 ## 5 the 272 ## 6 in 264 ## 7 my 209 ## 8 of 194 ## 9 for 138 ## 10 is 128 Wow, amazing insights. Anyways. (this is where stop words come in) Let’s load in a dataset with stop words (a set of commonly used words that are usually not interesting) data(stop_words) Now, we will delete these stop words from our dataset by using the anti_join() function (see the dplyr package in the Useful Package section). unnested &lt;- unnested %&gt;% anti_join(stop_words) ## Joining with `by = join_by(word)` Let’s see what the most used words are now: unnested %&gt;% count(word, sort=TRUE)%&gt;% top_n(10, n) ## word n ## 1 psychology 94 ## 2 i’m 58 ## 3 university 49 ## 4 school 46 ## 5 degree 41 ## 6 masters 39 ## 7 psych 37 ## 8 program 35 ## 9 time 34 ## 10 research 32 Unnest tokens can also work at the sentence level We just need to specify that the unit we want to split by by specifying “token = …..”; Check the documentation for other units you can tokenize by. psych_df %&gt;% unnest_tokens(output = &quot;sentence&quot;, input = &quot;body&quot;, token = &quot;sentences&quot;) %&gt;% select(title, sentence) %&gt;% head(5) ## title ## 1 [USA] Read this if you are interested in a career in mental healthcare ## 2 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## 3 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## 4 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## 5 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## sentence ## 1 if you are interested in pursuing a career in mental healthcare in the us, or if you have questions about different undergrad or graduate pathways to pursuing such a career, please read this before posting an advice thread: ## 2 [previous megathread: april 2024]( whilst study participation requests are almost completely barred from being posted in general (see rule i), you may post your links here, with all relevant information (as much as possible) included for potential participants; for the collation of a directory of studies and surveys. ## 3 furthermore, we recommend all researchers to take note of posting their surveys on [r/samplesize]( for research related to *covid-19*/coronavirus, additional advice is given to utilise [r/coronavirus]( [study megathread]( users, who have been tagged, that have posted on our previous monthly thread (*april 2024*) within the past three days, have had their surveys reposted as a comment by moderation for convenience and courtesy. ## 4 thank you very much and all best wishes with your research and your studies! ## 5 &amp;x200b; on behalf of r/psychologystudents, *organist1999* (subreddit moderator) &amp;x200b; **next megathread: june 2024** "],["useful-packages.html", "Chapter 3 Useful Packages 3.1 Tidyverse", " Chapter 3 Useful Packages don’t forget that to install a package, you type install.packages(“tidyverse”) into the console and then run this to load the package: library(tidyverse) First, your good old friend: 3.1 Tidyverse is actually a package containing other packages that you will very likely use in most of your analyses. These core packages include: ggplot2 dplyr tidyr readr purrr tibble stringr forcats (but there’s others too) Let’s have a look at some of the most useful ones. 3.1.1 ggplot2 Great for plots! You have probably used it in DAPR already - you will use it in this course too. Usually, it starts with the function ggplot(), you then give it a dataset and specify what you want it to look like (aesthetic mapping) with aes(). Here is an example: ggplot(psych_words,aes(x=words,y=n))+ geom_col(fill = &quot;lightblue&quot;)+ labs(title =&quot;Most common words in the psych dataset&quot;) Boring, but this is a plot that shows the most used words in our previous dataset (I did some data wrangling beforehand to create the psych_words dataframe - by tokenizing psych_df!). Click here to find a nice Data Visualization with ggplot2 cheatsheet. 3.1.2 dplyr A very very useful package for data handling. The most common functions from the package are: mutate() = adds a new variable (column) to the dataframe select() = picks out variables from a dataframe based on their name filter() = picks out cases based on a condition summarise() = gives you a summary of multiple values arrange() = arranges rows in a dataset (usually asceding or descending order) Some other functions you might see Zach using are “join” functions, which help you combine dataframes and retain certain values from each, depending on what you need. They are a bit confusing, but hopefully this explanation helps: I have two dataframes here: sleep ## course avg_sleep ## 1 DAPR2 7 ## 2 Psych in Action 10 ## 3 Big Data 4 ## 4 Psych 1A 9 ## 5 DAPR3 6 students ## course n_students ## 1 DAPR2 250 ## 2 Psych in Action 163 ## 3 Big Data 39 ## 4 Psych 1A 300 ## 5 Critical Analysis 161 Now let’s see what the join functions do: 1. inner_join() keeps observations from the first dataframe that have a matching key in the second dataframe (NOTE: join_by() specifies what variable should be our matching variable) inner_join(sleep, students, join_by(course)) ## course avg_sleep n_students ## 1 DAPR2 7 250 ## 2 Psych in Action 10 163 ## 3 Big Data 4 39 ## 4 Psych 1A 9 300 This one put the two dataframes together but left out Critical Analysis and DAPR3, because they are only in one of the two dataframes. 2. left_join() keeps all observations in the first dataframe. left_join(sleep, students,join_by(course)) ## course avg_sleep n_students ## 1 DAPR2 7 250 ## 2 Psych in Action 10 163 ## 3 Big Data 4 39 ## 4 Psych 1A 9 300 ## 5 DAPR3 6 &lt;NA&gt; This time, Critical Analysis is left out because it is only in the second dataframe. 3. right_join() keeps all observations in the second dataframe right_join(sleep, students,join_by(course)) ## course avg_sleep n_students ## 1 DAPR2 7 250 ## 2 Psych in Action 10 163 ## 3 Big Data 4 39 ## 4 Psych 1A 9 300 ## 5 Critical Analysis &lt;NA&gt; 161 So, DAPR3 is left out because it is in the first dataframe. 4. full_join() keeps all observations from both dataframes full_join(sleep, students,join_by(course)) ## course avg_sleep n_students ## 1 DAPR2 7 250 ## 2 Psych in Action 10 163 ## 3 Big Data 4 39 ## 4 Psych 1A 9 300 ## 5 DAPR3 6 &lt;NA&gt; ## 6 Critical Analysis &lt;NA&gt; 161 Now we’ve got all the observations, but some have got missing values. 5. anti_join() keeps all observations from the first dataframe without a match in the second one. anti_join(sleep, students ,join_by(course)) ## course avg_sleep ## 1 DAPR3 6 Just DAPR3 is left from the first dataframe. Different variable names Thus far, all these functions required the same variables names for the two datasets that you want to join. There are two methods that we can take to tackle joining variables of different names. satisfaction ## courses satisfied ## 1 DAPR2 strongly agree ## 2 Psych in Action moderate ## 3 Big Data somewhat disagree ## 4 Psych 1A agree ## 5 Critical Analysis moderate Renaming the variable satisfaction_renamed &lt;- satisfaction %&gt;% rename(&quot;course&quot; = &quot;courses&quot;) satisfaction_renamed ## course satisfied ## 1 DAPR2 strongly agree ## 2 Psych in Action moderate ## 3 Big Data somewhat disagree ## 4 Psych 1A agree ## 5 Critical Analysis moderate full_join(satisfaction_renamed, students,join_by(course)) ## course satisfied n_students ## 1 DAPR2 strongly agree 250 ## 2 Psych in Action moderate 163 ## 3 Big Data somewhat disagree 39 ## 4 Psych 1A agree 300 ## 5 Critical Analysis moderate 161 Specifying which variables in each dataframe to compare full_join(satisfaction, students, by = c(&quot;courses&quot; = &quot;course&quot;)) ## courses satisfied n_students ## 1 DAPR2 strongly agree 250 ## 2 Psych in Action moderate 163 ## 3 Big Data somewhat disagree 39 ## 4 Psych 1A agree 300 ## 5 Critical Analysis moderate 161 Here I specified the variable “courses” I want in the satisfaction dataframe and equate it to th variable “course” I want to compare to from the students dataframe. Hopefully this was comprehensive enough for you to understand the bascis, but if you want more guidance check out this cheatsheet for the dplyr package.

See this cheatsheet or this cheatsheet for some useful guidance I wish I knew. 4.3.1 Punctuations Let’s filter for titles that contain any type of punctuation. This code gives 5 titles with punctuation: psych_df %&gt;% mutate( punct = str_detect(title, regex(&quot;[:punct:]+&quot;)) ) %&gt;% filter(punct == TRUE) %&gt;% select(title) %&gt;% head(5) ## title ## 1 [USA] Read this if you are interested in a career in mental healthcare ## 2 [May 2024] Post Study Participation Requests Here (Link/Text posts on their own will be removed) - Monthly Megathread ## 3 What are some decent paying jobs you can do with a bachelors in psychology? ## 4 Any Organisational Psychlogist here? ## 5 can i be a psychiatric nurse practitioner and get a PhD? The “+” after [:punct:] will match punctuation at least once, so multiple punctuation in a row will be detected too e.g. “I….want to score well in DAPR3” This code gives titles without any punctuation: psych_df %&gt;% mutate( punct = str_detect(title, regex(&quot;[:punct:]+&quot;)) ) %&gt;% filter(punct == FALSE) %&gt;% select(title) %&gt;% head(5) ## title ## 1 Borderline Personality Disorder Research ## 2 Studying psych in EU but working in Australia ## 3 Letters of Recommendation for grad school ## 4 I regret not choosing Psychology ## 5 I just failed BLEPP 2024 and now am lost We can also use regex to separate strings into smaller ones by punctuation of any sort. basic_string &lt;- &quot;I, kinda really - want to \\ do well in BIG! Data! WOOO&quot; str_split(basic_string, regex(&quot;[:punct:]+&quot;)) %&gt;% as.data.frame(col.names = &quot;words&quot;) %&gt;% mutate( words = str_trim(words, side = &quot;both&quot;) ) ## words ## 1 I ## 2 kinda really ## 3 want to do well in BIG ## 4 Data ## 5 WOOO str_trim gets rid of white space to the left, right, or both sides of the string. 4.3.2 Fully capitalised words Now lets try to count the number of fully capitalised words in a title. I staggered the counts to see what each part of the regex does. psych_df %&gt;% mutate( fullycapitalised1 = str_count(title, regex(&quot;[A-Z]&quot;)), fullycapitalised2 = str_count(title, regex(&quot;[A-Z]{2,}&quot;)), fullycapitalised3 = str_count(title, regex(&quot;\\\\b[A-Z]{2,}\\\\b&quot;)) ) %&gt;% arrange(desc(fullycapitalised3)) %&gt;% select(title, fullycapitalised1, fullycapitalised2, fullycapitalised3) %&gt;% head(5) ## title fullycapitalised1 fullycapitalised2 fullycapitalised3 ## 1 UBC or SFU: MEd Counselling Psychology 10 3 2 ## 2 Is working as an RBT a smart move if I want to get a Masters in ABA? 9 2 2 ## 3 [USA] MSW or PsyD for grad school? 8 2 2 ## 4 [USA]: MA in Clinical Psychology program at Northwestern - thoughts? 8 2 2 ## 5 UK psychology student doing year abroad in USA 5 2 2 The first regex code counts the number of upper case letters in the title. So for the first title there are U, B, C… 10 capital letters. The second regex code captures words with two or more consecutive capitalised letters. The third regex code adds white space (empty string) before and after the capture word so that words like “MEd” or “MSc” don’t get counted. 4.3.3 Negated words psych_df %&gt;% mutate( n_negations = str_count(body, regex(&quot;n&#39;t&quot;)) ) %&gt;% select(body, n_negations) %&gt;% filter(n_negations == 2) ## body ## 1 **(Myanmar)**\\n\\nHi, so I just finished my IGCSE and I&#39;m looking to either attend **high schoo**l or **IB.** Here&#39;s the problem... I don&#39;t know where to go. My parents are thinking about sending me to Malaysia to do **ADTP** at **Sunway** or **INTI**. Originally, they were planning on sending me to **CATS Boston**, but it turns out that the boarding fees alone exceed half of our budget ( **\\\\~30 000** ), I did manage to snag a scholarship of 60 per cent, which brought the total -including tuition fees- to **\\\\~50 000**. Of course, it&#39;s still too much for us to handle. Now, I don&#39;t know what to do. \\n\\nPlease note that I have tried to research schools myself, but to no avail. Knowing my educational standard, I doubt I&#39;d be able to get into Stanford with just my **IGCSE** results alone. I am planning on majoring in psychology, possibly as far as getting a doctorate. \\n\\n1. A good environment to learn and socialise\\n2. We have a budget of **40K to 50K**, any lower is better\\n3. Opportunity to study at a prestigious university after finishing **high school** or **IB** ( maybe like Stanford?? )\\n4. **An opportunity for scholar too?**\\n\\n**Any suggestions?** ## 2 I am about to start my first term at a Uni for graduate school.\\n\\n \\nThis University is a logistical nightmare, I have had every possible issue, and I have felt like I have been pulling my hair out all summer. The fact that some Alumni have even told me that this is normal is validating and disheartening. \\n\\n \\nMy current issue is I am missing something for medical clearance that I was not told about until last Friday. Got it done and it will take a week at minimum to get the report back, which is when classes start. I have to be medically cleared to attend said classes, when I reached out asking if I will be-their response was &quot;Okay, thanks&quot;\\n\\nMy brother in Christ, will you temporarily approve me until my report comes in? Do I need to drop my classes? Like that is literally next week. You should also have a note about students who have had the utter joy of having chicken pox TWICE and needing to prove immunity. \\n\\nAsked my advisor and haven&#39;t heard back. Other side/issue, I started a new job in the public school system and realized that graduate school has a very strict schedule. Only one time slot available, which is fine until it&#39;s a 4pm class and students don&#39;t get out until 3:46. (which is currently my issue and my advisor told me to just make an accommodation with my prof)\\n\\n \\nSO, do I just give up and try an online University to accommodate my schedule. Do I keep fighting and hope for the best, and prepare for even more logistical issues? I was told it does not end and that I will LOVE the classes, but absolutely hate everything else. Not very convincing to stay around when it feels like the universe is screaming to get out. Thanks xo ## 3 I&#39;d like to say I don&#39;t regret the school or the program that I chose. I love Marriage and Family Therapy. However, I live in a state where it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE to find a supervisor. I&#39;ve only been interviewed by one, and it&#39;s been a while since she got back to me. I can only assume she&#39;s not interested in having me as an intern. I&#39;ve also sent messages to other supervisors in distant cities to see if I could be their intern, but I haven&#39;t heard a peep. I&#39;m not actually going to give up, but it&#39;s dampening my mood. :-( ## 4 I&#39;m currently working toward my BA degree in general psychology. I&#39;m a junior standing, so ive got about a year or two left of school depending on how I schedule my classes from here on. Got my AA when I graduated highschool through running start, so most of my ucore credits are already fulfilled. Im looking to get into research (I&#39;m a HUGE statistics nerd) and plan on attending graduate school a few years after uni to get my phD in quantitative psychology (but more on thst later). I have a lot of elective credits left to fulfill, so I thought that pairing my major with a double major in data science or minoring in statistics would be a good route to take. But are there any other majors/minors that would be more worth while to look into besides data science or statistics? or any that would help build toward my passion in research/statistics? The statistics program isn&#39;t the best at my uni, but I&#39;m worried that the statistics class I took under the psych program won&#39;t translate very well with the &quot;normal&quot; statistics classes if I were to choose it as my minor. \\n\\n ## 5 I&#39;m about to turn 30. I taught English in Korea for a few years and have spent a few other years doing basically nothing, trying to decide what to do. My degree was in Philosophy. I planned to work in Hollywood and got some great internships, but was unable to turn that into any sort of job. \\n\\nAnyways, lately I&#39;m thinking of becoming some sort of therapist. But I can&#39;t figure out which degree would make sense to pursue. It seems like there&#39;s so many different options. I&#39;m excited about potentially going down this path, but also stressed about trying to figure out the best way to do it. \\n\\nMS in Counseling \\n\\nClinical Psych PHD\\n\\nCounseling PsyD\\n\\nNursing-PMHNP Masters\\n\\nMed School\\n\\netc\\n\\nI initially thought about school psychology, but after working in an American school, I changed my mind about that. Also I&#39;m a huge night owl. Given the choice, I naturally wake up about 11am. I&#39;ve tried to force myself to wake up early and it never sticks. Obviously I did in when I was in school, but I had no choice. I think it negatively affected me even back then. One of the things that appeals to me about being a therapist is that I&#39;ve heard you can set your own schedule. I also like talking to people and teaching. I really like having 1 on 1 classes. Helping people would be nice. And I really prefer to have autonomy in my work. \\n\\nHow can I decide which one is right for me? Is there any in particular you would recommend or advise against? Being almost done with my 20s, I&#39;m feeling a lot of pressure to decide on something. But just trying to google these hasn&#39;t really helped me move closer to a decision. \\n\\nThank you. \\n\\n ## n_negations ## 1 2 ## 2 2 ## 3 2 ## 4 2 ## 5 2 More examples tbd. 4.4 Scraping data from HTML This tutorial is adapted from Chris Bail’s Screen-scraping in R &amp; Wickham et al.’s R for Data Science. We’ll be using the package rvest to scrape information from html pages, which is useful for information contained within tables such as this Interjection dictionary or the top movies on IMDB. Let’s start with the table in Interjection dictionary. First, we’ll read the entire html source code from the website we are interest into R. interjections_html &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://www.vidarholen.net/contents/interjections/&quot;) # Reading the entire page into R interjections_html ## {html_document} ## &lt;html&gt; ## [1] &lt;head&gt;\\n&lt;meta http-equiv=&quot;Content-Type&quot; content=&quot;text/html; charset=UTF-8&quot;&gt;\\n&lt;title&gt;Dictionary of Interjections (aww, oh ... ## [2] &lt;body&gt;\\n &lt;h1&gt;Dictionary of Interjections&lt;/h1&gt;\\n Here is a list of English interjections, specifically those that a ... The result is HTML code, which is the programming language web developers use to define the structure and content of the website. In Google, you can inspect the html code of any website by right clicking with your cursor and pressing the “inspect” tab. Importantly, HTML code has a nested structure, typically including “head” a “body” sections of the webpage. The content are mostly contained within tags such as “p” (paragraph) and “h1” (heading 1), I won’t go into too much detail what these are but feel free to look up any HTML tutorial to learn more about these elements. Once you have the html code in R, you can use the html_nodes() function to specify what sort of elements you want to extract. For our purpose, we will specify “table”: interjections_dict1 &lt;- interjections_html %&gt;% html_nodes(&quot;table&quot;) %&gt;% .[[1]] %&gt;% # Which table you want to extract (if there are multiple tables on a webpage) html_table() head(interjections_dict1) # This gives you a dataframe that you can work with! ## # A tibble: 6 × 5 ## Word `Alternate/ Similar` Translation Example Meaning ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; ## 1 aah! &quot;aaah, aaaahh&quot; &quot;\\&quot;Help!\\&quot;&quot; &quot;\\&quot;Aaaah!

You can scrape specific elements of a webpage, depending on the HTML element you specify. Let’s say you want to scrape all the text within paragraphs (“p”) of Sigmund Freud’s Wikipedia website. freud_html &lt;- read_html(&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud&quot;) %&gt;% # Reading the entire wiki page into R html_elements(&quot;p&quot;) %&gt;% # Specify all &quot;p&quot; elements in the webpage html_text2() # Extract the text content of the HTML elements freud_html[[3]] # This gives you a list of all the paragraph text on the webpage ## [1] &quot;Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austrian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna.[5][6] Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902.[7] Freud lived and worked in Vienna having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. Following the German annexation of Austria in March 1938, Freud left Austria to escape Nazi persecution. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.&quot; 4.4.2 Some caveats Legality If the data is public, non-personal, and factual, it should be fine to scrape*. You should cite the websites you use, and always read the terms of conditions if present. APIs This short tutorial doesn’t cover more dynamic websites, or websites that utilise an Application Programming Interface (API), which are a set of functions or procedures the website has specified to access their data.

Why? Your findings are only as good as your data. If your data is bad, or if it’s going to be really hard to clean up your data to get a nice dataframe to work with, our advice would be to look for something else. Luckily there’s really so much data out there and you can find plenty of avenues to get started below. Once you have your data, start to think about the following: What psychological questions can I ask with the data? What psychological theories can I test with the data? (note: This is really important for a cohesive project!) Is the data mainly text- or numerical- based? What sort of methods/analysis can I run on the data and what results do I anticipate from them? This advice is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully it is helpful to get you started! 5.2 Datasets BROAD Kaggle Niderhoff’s repository of NLP datasets Awesome Public Datasets repository u/Istrakh’s Reddit post Public APIs repository u/Stuck_In_The_Matrix’s Reddit comments datasets Arctic Shift’s Reddit Academic Torrents repository Gallup’s Global Datasets for Public Use SPECIFIC Khodak et al. (2018) Reddit /s sarcasm Dataset of r/AmITheAsshole comments Dataset of r/TipOfMyTongue 5.3 Project Ideas Start looking at hot topics from computational social science journals such as: Computational Social Science Big data and society Social media and society Social network analysis and mining Don’t copy, just get inspired Some ideas we came up with (will add more if we get creative): r/TipOfMyTongue and link it to the actual memory literature to see which sorts of events it predicts to be most memorable LinkedIn has interesting language on it, would be interesting to work on a project investigating why this sort of language exists on the platform (maybe this dataset: LinkedIn Influencers’ Data) 5.4 Useful Resources 5.4.1 Reference Text Mining with R: A Tidy Approach (Julia Silge &amp; David Robinson) Text As Data (Chris Bail) Text Mining for Social Scientists (Felix Lennert) Supervised Machine Learning for Text Analysis in R (Emil Hvitfeldt &amp; Julia Silge) R cheatsheets An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R (easier) Elements of statistical learning (harder) R for statistical learning (David Dalpiaz) Caret Package Guidebook 5.4.2 Other useful resources Flowchart Maker OSF (To host project files) Latex overleaf (To format documents) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
