# Others: Potential Datasets, Project Ideas, and Useful Resources

## What to look for in a project 

* In general, start by looking for a dataset you're interested in. Why? Your findings are only as good as your data. If your data is bad, or if it's going to be really hard to clean up your data to get a nice dataframe to work with, our advice would be to look for something else. Luckily there's really so much data out there and you can find plenty of avenues to get started below. 

* Once you have your data, start to think about the following: 

  - What psychological questions can I ask with the data? 

  - What psychological theories can I test with the data? (note: This is really important for a cohesive project!)

  - Is the data mainly text- or numerical- based? What sort of methods/analysis can I run on the data and what results do I anticipate from them? 

* This advice is by no means exhaustive, but hopefully it is helpful to get you started!

## Project Ideas 

Start looking at hot topics from computational social science journals such as: 

- [Computational Social Science](https://link.springer.com/journal/42001) 

- [Big data and society](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/bds)

- [Social media and society](https://journals.sagepub.com/home/sms)

- [Social network analysis and mining](https://link.springer.com/journal/13278)

Donâ€™t copy, just get inspired 

Some ideas we came up with (will add more if we get creative): 

- r/TipOfMyTongue and link it to the actual memory literature to see which sorts of events it predicts to be most memorable
- LinkedIn has interesting language on it, would be interesting to work on a project investigating why this sort of language exists on the platform (maybe this dataset: [LinkedIn Influencers' Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shreyasajal/linkedin-influencers-data))
